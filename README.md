# 🌦️ Telangana Weather Analysis (2021–2024) | Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes **Telangana weather data from 2021 to 2024** to understand patterns and trends in **temperature, humidity, and wind speed** across different districts and mandals. The dashboard highlights **seasonal variations** and **year-wise trends** using interactive visuals.

This project demonstrates my practical experience in **Power BI, data transformation, DAX calculations, and data storytelling**.
